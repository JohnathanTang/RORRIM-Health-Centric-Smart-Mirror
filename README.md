# RORRIM: Health-Centric Smart Mirror

For our senior design project, our team designed, developed, and constructed a health-centric smart mirror that incorporates smart devices and machine learning to promote a healthy lifestyle. 

## Background 
RORRIM is a smart mirror that hopes to encourage the incorporation of smart technology to promote a healthy lifestyle by displaying personal health data information in plain view. The display shows health data including heart rate, step count, SpO2, and wrist temperature specific to a suer in addition to information time and weather. To manage multiple end-users, RORRIM has a facial recognition feature which is primarily used to register or change users and switch between personalized profiles. Health data is measured and pulled from a Fitbit and noninvasive Arduino sensors. The user's health information is stored both locally on the Raspberry Pi and also uploaded to a secure Firebase server. Through machine learning, this health information makes personal inferences about stress state at a 91% accuracy and recommendations to assist the user for living a healthier lifestyle.
